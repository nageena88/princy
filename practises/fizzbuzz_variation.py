# Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

# Sample Output :

# fizzbuzz
# 1
# 2
# fizz
# 4
# buzz

i = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 50: "))
if i > 50:
    print("Number out of range")
    exit(0)
if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
elif i % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
elif i % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
else:
    print(i)
